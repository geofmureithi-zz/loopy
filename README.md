#### New Features Coming soon!

  - Move money to bank
  - Create investments
  - Global lib so you can just do `loopy` in your bash

#### Why?

I wanted to send my mother money without leaving the terminal (talk of being lazy!!), so I setup this.
This can be very important in automation of your bill payments :)
